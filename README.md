# Mango Leaf Disease Detection System

## Overview

This innovative AI-powered system provides advanced disease detection for mango leaves using state-of-the-art deep learning technology. Designed to address critical challenges in agricultural disease management, our solution offers rapid, accurate, and objective diagnosis of mango leaf conditions.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Disease Detection**: Identifies 8 distinct mango leaf conditions:
  - Anthracnose
  - Bacterial Canker
  - Weevil Damage
  - Dieback
  - Gall
  - Powdery Mildew
  - Sooty Mold
  - Healthy Leaf State

- **Multi-Optimizer CNN Model**
  - Utilizes four optimization techniques:
    * Adagrad
    * Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
    * Adam
    * RMSprop

- **High Accuracy Performance**
  - Exceptional detection accuracy ranging from 98.53% to 99.47%

- **Interactive AI Chatbot Interface**
  - Real-time disease diagnosis
  - Preventive measures and treatment suggestions
  - Continuous learning capabilities
